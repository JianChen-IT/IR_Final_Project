# Information retrieval - Final Project
This repository contains the delivery of the Information Retrieval Final Project, subject taught in the UPF (1st Term 2020). The content of this report contains the recommended structure provided by the Project Guidelines provided by Prof.Fabbri.

## Content

**Section 1 - Data collection**

- Here the information about the data collection, like the aggregated statistics of the collected data (number of tweets, number of users, etc..)
- the keywords used for the data collection
- the approximate time needed to collect the data.

**Section 2 - Search Engine**

Without considering the GitHub repo:
- Description of the pre-processing strategy
- WordCloud generated by the whole corpus (or at least a relevant sample). Only the words considered for the inverted index have to be included.
- Bar plot of the 10 most frequent words (same set of the WordCloud)
- Description and example to describe your score to rank the documents
- Screenshot to compare the difference between the classical ranking and the one by your score (screenshot of the output generated by the search-engine)

**Section 3 - RQs**

- _Subsection RQ1_
    - List of 10 selected queries
    - Answer to Question d
    - Output given by t-sne
    - Answer to question RQ 1A - reasoning and plots may help.
    - Answer to question RQ 1B - a table for each cluster may help.

- _Subsection RQ2_
    - Describe the diversity score and the post-processing strategy
    - List of chosen queries. 
    - Answer to RQ 2A - plots and tables may help
    - Answer to RQ 2B - plots may help

- _Subsection RQ3_
    - Summary statistics of the retweet graph, train and test.
    - Answer to RQ 3A - tables and details about trained models may help
    - Answer to RQ 3B - Proposed algorithm and table of the performances

### Section 1 - Data Collection

**1.1 Information about the data collection** 
This subsection contains the number of original tweets and the number of retweets.
- Original tweets number: 
- Number of retweets:

**1.2 Keywords used for the data collection**

Here are the keywords:  _Donald, Trump, Joe, Biden, America, USA, fraud, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Republicans, Democrats, Votes, States_. By selecting these keywords, we tried to summarize the main topics about the US Elections, and the words have been selected by watching the latest news, no scientific method used here.

**1.3 Time needed to collect the data**
The time spent to collect 100k data has been quite long, and we tried to parallelize the process. However, the Twitter API do not allow to have more than 1 process per account running. Here is the time that we needed to collect 100k
- Data collection time for 100k Tweets:
